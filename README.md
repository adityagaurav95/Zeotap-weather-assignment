# Zeotap-weather-assignment

This project is designed to retrieve weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API at configurable intervals, convert temperature values based on user preference, and provide daily weather summaries including additional parameters like humidity and wind speed. The system is built to be robust, easy to set up, and extendable.

:- Setup of the system: Activates and links to the OpenWeatherMap API with a legitimate API key.

:-Retrieving data: Mimics API requests at set time intervals to get and analyze weather information for specified places.

:-Temperature Conversion: Changes temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius or Fahrenheit depending on user choice.

:-Summary of daily weather: Provides weather forecasts for multiple days, estimating average, highest, and lowest temperatures, as well as prevailing weather conditions.

:-Extra options: Enables access and examination of supplementary weather data like moisture level and velocity of the air.

:-Forecast for weather conditions for the next 5 days.
